# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for my Arch GNU/Linux box (ThinkPad T420).

Trying to keep it simple and mostly terminal-based.

## Applications

- Display Manager: None! Just a regular tty1 console login
- Window Manager: `community/i3-gaps` with `community/dmenu` and `aur/polybar`
- Shell: `core/bash`
- Terminal Emulator: `community/rxvt-unicode`
- Text Editor: `vim` (through `extra/gvim` for X11 support) and visual studio `community/code`
- Web Browser: `extra/firefox`
- File Manager: `aur/lf` (terminal-based)
- Chat: `community/discord`
- Music Player: `community/ncmpcpp` with `extra/mpd`
